# Unit-converter-using-tkinter
📋 Description

This is a simple Unit Converter application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to convert values between different units of length, weight, and temperature through an intuitive graphical interface.

🎯 Features

Convert between:

Length: Meter ↔ Kilometer

Weight: Gram ↔ Kilogram

Temperature: Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit

User-friendly dropdown menus to select units.

Validates user input and shows helpful error messages.

Built with Tkinter — no external libraries required.

🛠️ How It Works

User enters a numeric value.

Selects a "From" unit and a "To" unit from dropdowns.

Clicks the "Convert" button.

The program performs the appropriate conversion and displays the result.

💡 Example Conversions

1000 Meters → 1.00 Kilometer

5000 Grams → 5.00 Kilograms

100 Celsius → 212.00 Fahrenheit

⚠️ Input Validation

If the user enters a non-numeric value, an error message is displayed.

Invalid conversions between unrelated units (e.g., "Meter" to "Fahrenheit") are caught and reported.
